### Technologies
Java, Springboot, Spring Security, WebSocket, MySQL, AWS(RDS), React.js, Redux, Bootstrap, Mui, Google(Maps, Oauth)      
I was working mainly on Spring Security and Google Oauth to maintain users, but contributed to everything else as well on the project.    
I was also working on getting real-time notifications to users, when multiple users were logged in at the same time. That was made via Websockets.
